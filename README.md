# Aphid

This language is just for the learning experience of writing a stackbased, bytecode backed language.

It is not intended for serious use.

## Goals
 - [x] can store variables with static typing (once a variable is a type it cannot be re-typed)
 - [x] can read variables
 - [x] can do arithmatic
 - [x] can compare values ==, >, <
 - [x] can define and execute conditional loops
 - [x] can define and execute if-else
